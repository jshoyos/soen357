		  <h1>Case Study: UX/UI Design of a Healthy Screen Habits Super App</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="content">
			<h1 align="center">Project Description</h1>
		  <h2>Introduction</h2>
		  <p align="justify">In recent years, health and wellness have become a worldwide concern. The occurrence of wellness and mental issues has increased and continues to rise every year. Some studies show that the most consistent increase in depression and other mental health issues happened from 1930 to 1990. However, no improvement has been observed in the past 20 years. With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, these issues have grown even larger. People around the world are forced to obey strict quarantine 	measures, spend more time in front of a screen than ever before, be it for work, school, or entrainment.
			   While doing so, they neglect the importance of a healthy and balanced lifestyle. For the purpose of our case study project,
			    we designed a <a href="definitions.html">super app</a> to promote a healthy
				 lifestyle by encouraging breaks from our daily screen time and reminding us that our wellbeing is our top priority.
			</p>
		  <p align="justify">In recent years people have significantly increased their screen exposure. With the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic the issue has grown even larger. This phenomenon plays into the hands of many big platforms and applications by catering to their main goal: keep users on their page as long as possible. We believe that people should have a “super app” to help cut down their screen time and focus on their wellbeing.</p>

		  <h2>Understanding The Problem</h2>
		  <p align="justify">
			This issue is closely rooted to the pandemic, introducing new social restrictions and nation-wide lockdowns. It is important to think proactively of our daily screen time and begin to understand the long term repercussions. Specifically, the mental and physical effects of excessive screen time can lead to anxiety, poor posture, sleep issues, weight gain, risk of heart disease, and more. Currently users interact with their various devices throughout their daily activities. An individual will study/work on their computer, socially interact on their cell phone and watch entertainment on their television. The users of these devices lack incentive to reduce their screen time. This change could significantly reduce a user’s screen exposure and help prevent the negative effects of prolonged screen usage. There currently exists some competition for various health and activity tracking apps. Our product will differ from the competition thanks to our specific goal. We intend to create a central location where a user can access all the health and activity data they require.

  		<h2>Solution</h2>
  		<p align=justify>
  			Our platform will offer the feeling of relief and gratification through a super app that limits a user's 
			screen time while emphasizing wellness. Me-Time is a single application that contains all of the necessary information to track one’s 
			health and wellbeing. The app will be easily integrated into a users normal lifestyle with the goal to get them off their phone.
			The app initially takes some of the users personal information and uses it to optimize the way it records and presents data. 
			The user will be offered customized exercise plans tailored to them and their busy schedule. 
			They will also have the option to have specific apps disabled at certain times of the day to promote less screen time and earlier bedtimes. 
			Some issues seen with competing apps is the price point, we will offer a free service that will be funded through donations and ad revenue. 
			When designing the UI, we prioritized an easy to use and simple design to help users find what they need efficiently, but stay appealing to the eyes.
  		</p>

  		<h1 align="center">Research</h1>
  			<h2>Surveys</h2>
  				<p>The best way to develop an application that will efficiently serve its user base is to get their opinion.
  				To do so, we conducted a survey as part of our research in order to get more opinions on what issues we should focus on.
  				The results of our survey showed that the majority of people spend 7 hours or more per day on screen time.
  			</p>
  			<img src="images/Survey_Screen_Time.png" class="survey" alt="Survey">
				<p>
					Also, our survey also showed that 16 people out of 25 evaluated their screen habits as being more towards the unhealthy side
					with not a single person believeing their habits to be very healthy.
				</p>
			<img src="images/Survey_Unhealthy.png" class="survey" alt="Survey">
			<p>
				This shows that there is clearly a market for people who want to try and spend less time on their devices.
				Additionally, over 60% of people spend most of their screen time on entertainment and social media, these are habits
				that can be worked on to free up time to do more productive activities.

		<h2>User Goals</h2>
  		<p align=justify>
  			The creation of these personas along with the responses from our survey, we were able to define goals that unite the needs and desires of many 
			users/potential users. The primary goal is to provide users with an application that helps them reduce their screen time, 
			fix their sleeping habits and find time to exercise and stay fit. 
			All of these features will be available in one, easy to navigate, super app with a user-friendly interface that guides them along the way.
