# Introduction
<p align="justify">
  In recent years, health and wellness have become a worldwide concern. The occurrence of wellness and mental issues has increased and continues to rise every year.
  Some studies show that the most consistent increase in depression and other mental health issues happened from 1930 to 1990.
  However, no improvement has been observed in the past 20 years. With the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, these issues have grown even larger.
  People around the world are forced to obey strict quarantine measures, spend more time in front of a screen than ever before, be it for work, school, or entrainment.
  While doing so, they neglect the importance of a healthy and balanced lifestyle. For the purpose of our case study project, we designed a super app to promote a healthy lifestyle by promoting and encouraging breaks from our daily screen time and reminding us that our wellbeing is our top priority.

# Understanding The Problem
<p align="justify">
  This issue is closely rooted to the pandemic introducing new social restrictions and countrywide lockdowns.
  It is important to think proactively on our daily screen time and begin to understand the long term repercussions.
  Specifically, the mental and physical effects of excessive screen time usage can lead to anxiety, poor posture, sleep issues, weight gain, risk of heart disease, and more.
  Currently, users interact with their various devices throughout their daily activities. An individual will studHealhy/work on their computer, social interact on their cell phone and watch entertainment on their television.
  The users of these screen devices lack incentive or enforcement to reduce their screen time. This change can significantly reduce a user’s screen exposure and help prevent the negative effects of prolonged screen usage. There currently exists some competition for various health and activity tracking apps. Our product will differ from the competition with a specific goal in mind. We intend to create a central location where a user can access all their health and activity data they require with the goal to reduce the user’s screen time.
